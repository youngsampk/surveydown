# Database setup --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Details at: https://surveydown.org/docs/storing-data
#
# surveydown stores data on any PostgreSQL database. We recommend
# https://supabase.com/ for a free and easy to use service.
#
# Once you have your database ready, run the following function to store your
# database configuration parameters in a local .env file:
# 
# sd_db_config()
#
# Once your parameters are stored, you are ready to connect to your database.
# For this demo, we set ignore = TRUE in the following code, which will ignore
# the connection settings and won't attempt to connect to the database. This is
# helpful if you don't want to record testing data in the database table while
# doing local testing. Once you're ready to collect survey responses, set
# ignore = FALSE or just delete this argument.

db <- sd_db_connect()
